In this directory:
	ptyjig_cross_platform.c: 
		modified ptyjig
	end/:
		end of different interactive utilities, such as vim, ftp, csh, htop and so on
	t1:
		a small test case
	test_case_for_vim:
		a sample test case for vim. To test vim, just run:
		./pty -d 0.05 vim < test_case_for_vim

		One can generate a test case for other interactive utilities by append end file to t1:
			cat t1 ./end/end_htop > test_case_for_htop
			./pty -d 0.05 htop < test_case_for_htop
		run.py will automatically concatenate the test case and the specific end before testing a utility
