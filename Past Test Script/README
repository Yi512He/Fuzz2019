-----------------------------------------------------------------

Please note that this is an alpha release of the fuzz software.  It is
not yet in a fully packaged form.  All the software should run with little
effort on 4.3BSD variants of UNIX.  Some changes and problems (especially
with ptyjig) will be encountered on System V variants.

If you make changes to the software in which others may be interested,
please send them back to us.  Our eventual goal is to produce a version
with makefiles and ifdef's to configure for many systems.

Feel free to send us commments, suggestions, complaints, and questions.  We'll
do what we can to help.

Directories
-----------
There are four directories, namely script1, script2, src, and doc.
Script1 contains the a set of shell scripts that uses pre-defined test
files (the ones we used in our initial paper).  Script2 has some additional
test files (generated by changing the random seed).  Src contains source code
for fuzz and ptyjig.  Doc contains manual pages for them.  Each of these
directories has its own README file. Please refer to them for more details.


Running the Tests
-----------------
To run the test, you must

1. Compile the programs in src.
2. Make sure the commands are installed in one of your paths.
3. The "run" command in either of the script directories will execute
   the tests.  You should feel free to make a new script directory to
   customize the scripts for your own system.

Note: run.master contains the programs names to test and these ones are
      good for ultrix4.3a.
