		updated fuzz.c and python script to generate test data
	./pty/
		updated cross-platform ptyjig and some end of interactive tools
	./test_Linux/
		name and option pools of each cmd to be tested on Linux
	./test_MacOS/
		name and option pools of each cmd to be tested on MacOS
	./test_FreeBSD/
		name and option pools of each cmd to be tested on FreeBSD
	./test_Xv6/
		updated fuzz tools on Xv6

	run.py
		automatically test all utilities listed in a file(see ./test_Linux/ or ./test_MacOS/ or ./test_FreeBSD/)
		One can edit run.py to specify all the settings
		The default setting is:
			test on small test cases
			timeout after 300 seconds
			utility names and options pools are from "./test_Linux/run.master_options"
			test result of each utility will be saved into "./log", each utility corresponds to a result file
			the script will combine result files into single file named "all"
		

To test basic utilities on Linux, run: 
	./basicTest.sh	

To test utilities using ptyjig on Linux, run: 
        ./sampleTestPty.sh

To test utilities on Xv6 platform, please do as follows:  

  # Go to Xv6 directory
  cd test_Xv6 

  # To run Xv6
  make qemu-nox

  # To run fuzz test in Xv6 environment
  testScript

  # To list generated testcases
  ls

  # To exit Xv6 environment
  Ctrl-A X

  # To clean up
  make clean
