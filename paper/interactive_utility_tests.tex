In addition to the utilities tested by basic fuzz tools, there are interactive utility programs whose input (and output) files must have the characteristics of a terminal device, which cannot be tested by standard output from the fuzz program. Thus, we updated ptyjig from the 1990 fuzz study and applied it to interactive utilities.

\subsection{Test Results}
We tested 8 interactive utilities across three platforms: Linux, MacOS and FreeBSD. They are: vim, htop, ex, csh, zsh, sh, ftp, telnet, among which ftp is unavailable on MacOS.
