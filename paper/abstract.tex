We have tested the reliability of utilities on four Unix variants platforms using random input strings, including Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD, and Xv6. We inherited and modified the original fuzz tools to generate test cases and then automatically test and detect failures. We documented and analyzed the testing results to further understand the bugs. We categorized the causes of failures in comparison with previous studies. After nearly three decades from the original study, the testing result indicates that fuzz tools are still sharp in crashing and hanging utilities. The failure rate on all platforms we tested is 24\%. 
Specifically, we discovered 17 crashes/hangs out of 73 utilities on Linux, 10 out of 79 utilities on FreeBSD, and 9 out of 81 on MacOS. The failure rate of Linux utilities is largely increased compiled to the 1995 study, while MacOS and FreeBSD have significantly higher reliability than Linux.
