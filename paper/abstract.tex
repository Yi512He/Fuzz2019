We have tested the reliability of utilities on four Unix variants platforms using random input strings, including Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD, and Xv6. We inherited and modified the original fuzz tools to generate test cases and then automatically test and detect failures. We documented and analyzed the testing results to further understand the bugs. We categorized the causes of failures in comparison with previous studies. After nearly three decades from the original study, the testing result indicates that fuzz tools are still sharp in crashing and hanging utilities. The failure rate on all platforms we tested is 20\%. 
Specifically, we discovered 9 crashes/hangs out of 76 utilities on Linux, 14 out of 79 utilities on FreeBSD, and 12 out of 79 on MacOS. The failure rate of Linux utilities is slightly increased compared to the 1995 study. Similarly, utilities on MacOS display an increased failure rate compared to 2006 study. FreeBSD has a higher failure rate than Linux and MacOS.
